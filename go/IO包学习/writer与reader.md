## io.writer接口

```go
// Writer is the interface that wraps the basic Write method.
//
// Write writes len(p) bytes from p to the underlying data stream.
// It returns the number of bytes written from p (0 <= n <= len(p))
// and any error encountered that caused the write to stop early.
// Write must return a non-nil error if it returns n < len(p).
// Write must not modify the slice data, even temporarily.
//
// Implementations must not retain p.
type Writer interface {
	Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
```

## io.Reader接口
```go
// Reader is the interface that wraps the basic Read method.
//
// Read reads up to len(p) bytes into p. It returns the number of bytes
// read (0 <= n <= len(p)) and any error encountered. Even if Read
// returns n < len(p), it may use all of p as scratch space during the call.
// If some data is available but not len(p) bytes, Read conventionally
// returns what is available instead of waiting for more.
//
// When Read encounters an error or end-of-file condition after
// successfully reading n > 0 bytes, it returns the number of
// bytes read. It may return the (non-nil) error from the same call
// or return the error (and n == 0) from a subsequent call.
// An instance of this general case is that a Reader returning
// a non-zero number of bytes at the end of the input stream may
// return either err == EOF or err == nil. The next Read should
// return 0, EOF.
//
// Callers should always process the n > 0 bytes returned before
// considering the error err. Doing so correctly handles I/O errors
// that happen after reading some bytes and also both of the
// allowed EOF behaviors.
//
// Implementations of Read are discouraged from returning a
// zero byte count with a nil error, except when len(p) == 0.
// Callers should treat a return of 0 and nil as indicating that
// nothing happened; in particular it does not indicate EOF.
//
// Implementations must not retain p.
type Reader interface {
	Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
```
使用场景主要在于将数据读取到指定的[]byte对象中，所以无法避免在这个过程中产生的数据复制问题。

## 错误类型
```go
// ErrShortWrite means that a write accepted fewer bytes than requested
// but failed to return an explicit error.
var ErrShortWrite = errors.New("short write")

// ErrShortBuffer means that a read required a longer buffer than was provided.
var ErrShortBuffer = errors.New("short buffer")

// EOF is the error returned by Read when no more input is available.
// Functions should return EOF only to signal a graceful end of input.
// If the EOF occurs unexpectedly in a structured data stream,
// the appropriate error is either ErrUnexpectedEOF or some other error
// giving more detail.
var EOF = errors.New("EOF")

// ErrUnexpectedEOF means that EOF was encountered in the
// middle of reading a fixed-size block or data structure.
var ErrUnexpectedEOF = errors.New("unexpected EOF")

// ErrNoProgress is returned by some clients of an io.Reader when
// many calls to Read have failed to return any data or error,
// usually the sign of a broken io.Reader implementation.
var ErrNoProgress = errors.New("multiple Read calls return no data or error")
```
